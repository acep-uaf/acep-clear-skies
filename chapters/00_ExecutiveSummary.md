# Executive Summary

Alaska has the world’s highest concentration of islanded microgrids—small, self-contained power systems that sustain hundreds of remote communities unconnected to any central grid.  These systems are lifelines, but they face growing challenges: rising fuel and logistics costs, access to technical talent, fragile Internet connectivity, and increasing exposure to cyber threats as digital controls expand into every corner of local infrastructure.

**Clear Skies** proposes a new path forward — a _local-first, Internet independent cyberinfrastructure reference architecture_ designed specifically with resiliency and security in mind for Alaska’s rural communities.  By establishing scalable, community-owned data and control systems, Clear Skies enables essential digital services—SCADA, communications, cybersecurity, and data management—to operate **independently of Internet access**.

The Clear Skies reference architecture defines a layered and modular approach to resilience:

- **Layer 0 – Hardware Foundations:** three tiers of scalable deployment (Camp, Village, Regional) that balance cost, capacity, and redundancy using commodity or enterprise hardware.
- **Layer 1 – Cyberinfrastructure (CI):** a local Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) providing virtualization, networking, storage, and identity services built on open-source tools such as Proxmox, Ceph, and OPNsense.
- **Layer 2 – Local Services:** modular applications for operational technology (OT), industrial IoT, emergency communications, and community collaboration—entirely hosted and managed within the local network.
- **Layer 3 – Community Connections:** secure, zero-trust bridges that enable inter-village collaboration, cross-site data sharing, and regional coordination while preserving digital sovereignty.

Clear Skies is more than an IT architecture—it is an **enabler of digital sovereignty**, extending the principles of local self-determination into the digital domain.  
Its modular design allows each community to start small, learn, and grow—building capacity, reducing dependency, and cultivating a workforce skilled in managing their own resilient, secure digital infrastructure.

The Clear Skies reference architecture strategically supports diverse use cases—Home Labs, Test Beds, Training Grounds, On-site CI, Community CI, Emergency Communications, and Industrial CI—providing a roadmap for communities not just to *keep the lights on*, but to illuminate their own path toward independence, innovation, and long-term sustainability in the digital era.
